#Where method_name = query we have the parameters search_query, id_list, start and max_results which can be seperated using &
#implement 3 second delay between each call
#Can use sortBy (relevance, lastUpdatedDate or submittedDate)
#sortOrder (ascending or descending)

#FEED METADATA
#Consists of <feed> element (metadata) and child <entry> elements. 
#<title> is the title of the feed, 
#<id> is unique and useful as a feed reader (want to keep track of feeds requested in the past)
#<link> is a url to retrieve this feed again
#<updated> containts last time contents in the feed were updated - updates only occur at midnight meaning we do not need to call the API for the same url multiple times

#http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/
#Can use OpenSearch to gather more information such as - totalResults, startIndex and itemsPerPage

#No errors means <feed> has 0 or more <entry> elements each representing an article in the returned results set. 
#If there is an error a single <entry> containing the error is returned

#ENTRY METADATA
#<title> contains title of article
#<id> url resolving to abtract page for the article - can get arxiv id by removing the leading http://arxiv.org/abs/
#<published> first version the article was submitted and processed
#<updated> date on which article was submitted and processed
#<summary> abstract of article
#<author> author of article
#<category> classifies as arXiv, ACM or MSC, has two attributes scheme (categorization scheme) and term (term used in categorization)
#<link> occurs 3 times distinguished by rel and title attributes, these occur in different flavours

#Some extension elements
#Can get arxiv primary classification
#comment - to get author comments
#affiliation - affiliation information

#note that we can further dwelve into different fields of an article for search up, for example titles of an article can be searched.
